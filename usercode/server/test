Query: "What are the primary behaviours and lifestyle factors that contribute to childhood obesity"
Facts:
<1923_100-100>: several lifestyle factors are described as behavioural contributors to childhood obesity, which are often associated with each other.

<272_6-7>: childhood obesity is also associated with several immediate health risk factors, such as orthopedic, neurological, pulmonary, gastroenterological, and endocrine conditions. obesity has been linked to negative psychosocial outcomes in children, such as low self-esteem and depression, making obesity indirectly linked to academic performance and adverse social outcomes over time.

<1923_5-5>: lifestyle behaviours known as most relevant lifestyle-related risk factors for obesity were selected as intervention targets: (1) diet, (2) physical activity and (3) stress.

<1923_62-64>: the present paper investigated the adherence of european children to selected health behaviours known to be associated with childhood obesity and being essential for children's optimal and healthy development. the results demonstrate that surprisingly low proportions of these children meet the recommended target values of the investigated health behaviours (8.8â€“52.5%). the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is an important contributor to childhood obesity confirmed even by longitudinal studies.

<3611_66-68>: physical inactivity serves as a major role in the rising prevalence of obesity, although other factors such as excess energy intake also contribute. in fact, lack of physical activity is a leading contributor to the rapid rise in obesity among aa and hispanic populations, particularly among women, and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. it is clear that a sedentary lifestyle contributes to cvd, hypertension, t2 dm, obesity, ms, ir, and hyperlipidemia.

<1923_79-81>: possible explanations are multifold, involving direct and indirect mechanisms contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic. food proved to be the most frequently advertised product category on children's tv, the majority of these products being energy dense and nutrient poor. this facilitates adverse dietary patterns: energy-dense snack consumption, fast-food consumption, energy-dense drink intake, higher total energy intake and higher percentage energy from fat. watching tv redirects attention from conscious eating and provides opportunity for unnoticed and unrestricted snacking.

<1923_90-90>: although we did not explicitly measure, for instance, the stress level of the family, but various other indicators of the quality of family life instead, it is interesting to note that the stress level of the family can be an important contributor to childhood obesity, and the other way round, obesity may increase the stress level.

<2581_65-66>: while obesity was more in higher ses, factors like family size, residence and parent's education did not contribute to obesity. however, with the rapid epidemiological transition occurring in large metropolitan cities and peri-urban areas, recent studies have shown a steady increase in prevalence among government school children.

<1923_0-2>: in the last decade, a rapid growth of the prevalence of obesity was experienced worldwide, the importance of which can be best illustrated with the forecast that this phenomenon could reverse the increase in life expectancy having been observed in the past decades. similar trends of obesity epidemic were also observed in the child population, which made it a worldwide public health crisis. later consequences of childhood obesity put a significant burden on, both, the individual's health and quality of life as well as on the health care system on a societal level. recently, the so-called obesity epidemic in children showed a flattening trend in several countries, probably due to preventive and intervention efforts. even if long-term observation will reinforce this favourable trend, obesity will still remain a major public health concern for the next decades to be managed by targeted interventions. the idefics (identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants) study was designed to (1) investigate the aetiology of childhood obesity, by assessing the contributing role of potential risk factors, that is, the effects of diet, lifestyle, psychosocial and genetic factors, and to describe their causal pathways.

<3611_64-64>: the role of psychosocial, socioeconomic, and environmental factors in the development of ir and obesity remains to be determined.

<4355_155-158>: funded by the robert wood johnson foundation, the project sought to recruit, train, and reinforce 160 pcps to become change agents and leaders in community advocacy to prevent childhood obesity. posttraining surveys showed that the training had increased participants' comfort and motivation advocating publicly for healthy behaviors, including active living (26%), healthy eating (25%), breastfeeding (24%), and school and worksite policies (15%). identifying successful models that integrate primary care, public health, and community-based efforts is important to accelerating progress in preventing childhood obesity. this review aimed to identify the roles that pcps play in childhood obesity prevention and treatment initiatives in the united states and, in doing so, to determine effective or promising strategies for primary care and community settings. the review, based on 96 peer-reviewed articles published from 2005 to 2012 that met study criteria, demonstrates that pcps are increasingly being included in childhood obesity interventions, consistent with current recommendations from scientific and professional organizations.

<1923_92-94>: child relationship, reduced social support and parenting care may have a role in establishing adverse diet patterns. this puts in focus the relationships within the family confirming the results of our intervention mapping approach, which addressed stress management as one of the intervention targets for the idefics study. the strengthening of a supportive family environment may have beneficial effects on stress coping and consequently on obesity.
